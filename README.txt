This is a game I conceived and tried to develop in the late 80's. Back then, I tried to write it in Assembly (on paper, consulting the hexadecimal code that provided me the commands. 

The game was about a monster that roamed a vertical maze. To go up, it would need to find and equip a jet. Then it would need to find a gun, so he could kill other monsters. Then, the last type of monster were ghosts. For them, you would need to find paint cans, throw them at the ghosts so they became visible and then shoot them.

Now, not only I am using it bc of nostalgia but also to learn a few things:
1. pygame
2. classes
3. multiplayer
among others

I will update this READ ME with more information.
